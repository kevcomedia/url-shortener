# URL Shortener Microservice

URL shortener project.

## User stories:
- I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the response.
- If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid `http://www.example.com` format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
- When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
